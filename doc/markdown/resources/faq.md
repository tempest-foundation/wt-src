# Wind/Tempest Project - FAQ

> [!WARNING]
> This FAQ is not final and will probably change as the project evolves.

## What is the difference between Wind and Tempest?

Wind is the operating system.  
Tempest is the kernel.

## How do I contribute to Wind/Tempest?

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/docs/markdown/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Why did you have the idea to make an OS from scratch?

To this day, I still don't remember why I decided to make a operating system +
kernel.

## Will you use another programming language than C? (that most OS/Kernel use it)

Yes.  I actually migrated all the C code to a C-like C++ code for organization.

## This is a hobby or you are trying to build a professional OS?

This OS/Kernel is a hobby project, as in [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md).  I am not trying to build a professional OS.

## Why did you choose the name Wind/Tempest?

Wind is like lightweight and calm frontend. (the OS or vision of the user)  
Tempest is like a stormy sea with strong winds (that is the kernel).

## Where to find all API documentation?

There is none for now, but I will add it soon.

## What's the CPU architecture you are targeting?

For now `amd64`. But in a future I plan to support other architectures like `aarch64`, `riscv` and etc.
